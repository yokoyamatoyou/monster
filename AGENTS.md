# AGENTS instructions

When modifying this repository, follow these guidelines:

- Consult `docs/project_plan_v3.md` for the latest project specifications.
- Use Python 3.11. Package versions in `requirements.txt` are not pinned.
- No fixed limits are placed on LLM usage; adjust configurations based on later usage patterns.
- Persist data in `/data` as CSV with columns: `timestamp`, `user_id`, `question_text`, `answer_text`, `total_question_count`, `evaluation_summary`. The last field stores a ~200 character summary generated by GPT-4.1 mini.
